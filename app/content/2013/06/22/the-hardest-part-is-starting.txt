I have been wanting to get a blog going for some time now and I could never get around to starting. I had a lot of ideas floating around my head, yet for one reason or another I could not get myself to commit. Through some reflection, I realized that I was in a similar situation the first time that I signed up on GitHub.

I was disillusioned that through putting myself (& code) out there, I would immediately open myself to criticism. I recalled the nervousness of that first commit, that first push, putting a part of myself out there for anyone to see. I had held off on writing software in my free time, simply because I was nervous. In a strange coincidence I now find myself placing the application for my blog on GitHub.

I digress.

I decided earlier this year that I was going to push myself to complete some of the ideas that I had floating around in my head; It is my hope that this blog becomes the embodiment of that decision. I plan on writing about a variety of topics from software to video games and computer hardware. By writing about what I am working on, I hope that it will keep me working on ideas that I am passionate about.

I was recently asked how I can work for 8+ hours a day and continue writing code when I am done with the day job. It struck me that I never consider it work; It is part of who I am. I am sure that many of my fellow programmers can attest to feeling the same way.

The hardest part for me was getting over my own insecurities. Here's to the start of learning something new.
