I often find myself nit picking minute sections of the code as a new project starts. I would spend hours considering things such as Rails or Sinatra, Angular or Backbone, Bootstrap or 960gs, and the list goes on.

In the end, all of this worry was nowhere near as important as just getting code written. By time boxing my decisions on these various frameworks, I found that I have been writing more code as well as gaining a clearer understanding for the underlying concepts.

Well written software can always be refactored. Conversely, software has to exist to be able to be refactored. In sticking to my commitment to improve my software skills, I have learned more in the past few months of writing software than I have in a long time.

The foundation only matters if you see an idea through to completion. I have learned (and continue to learn) that learning is writing & refactoring as much code as possible. It has improved my ability to make informed decisions as I continue onto the next big idea.
