After creating the initial layout for this blog, I went in search of creating more descriptive perma-links for posts.

I ran across <a href='https://github.com/FriendlyId/friendly_id/'>Friendly Id</a> on GitHub and decided to go that route after reading through the readme.

To update my application with friendly perma-links, it took very minor modifications.

After including the gem in your Gemfile, you will need to create a table to contain the friendly id text for your links. I have included the two tables below for my Posts example.

<br />
Creating the Posts Table, with a Slug column
<span class='source-code'>
<pre>
class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.date :date
      t.text :body
      t.string :slug
      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index :posts, :slug, unique: true
  end
end
</pre>
</span>

Creating the FriendlyIdSlugs Table
<span class='source-code'>
<pre>
class CreateFriendlyIdSlugs < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def self.up
    create_table :friendly_id_slugs do |t|
      t.string   :slug,           :null => false
      t.integer  :sluggable_id,   :null => false
      t.string   :sluggable_type, :limit => 40
      t.datetime :created_at
    end
    add_index :friendly_id_slugs, :sluggable_id
    add_index :friendly_id_slugs, [:slug, :sluggable_type], unique: true
    add_index :friendly_id_slugs, :sluggable_type
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :friendly_id_slugs
  end

end
</pre>
</span>

Once this is in place, tell your model which column to use for the friendly perma-link by including a friendly_id attribute.
<span class='source-code'>
<pre>
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  extend FriendlyId
  friendly_id :title, use: [:slugged, :history]

  attr_accessible :body, :date, :title
end
</pre>
</span>

Lastly, update the related controller methods to return friendly_id versions of their data by changing the methods to include friendly_id on the return.
<span class='source-code'>
<pre>
  def index
    @posts = Post.friendly_id.find(:all, :order => 'date DESC')
  end
</pre>
</span>

By adding .friendly_id before the .find in the PostsController, the returned url will be posts/:id where :id is the friendly_id defined in the model. I found this to be easier than implementing to_param inside of every model where I wanted to modify the link.
