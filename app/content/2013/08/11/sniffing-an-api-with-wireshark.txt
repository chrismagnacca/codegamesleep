If you know me, you know that I am a huge fan of newegg.com for anything computer hardware related. I have wanted access to the product information for awhile now to not only use in other applications, but to make a programmatic way to search through hardware rather than merely using the web interface provided by Newegg.

I decided a good first step was to figure out if there is an API that Newegg utilizes to service their web and mobile user interfaces. To accomplish this,

After poking around in Chrome's developer tools, I looked through the traffic and couldn't discern too much as there is a lot going on within the desktop website.

I decided a better idea would be to point my iPhone at the proxy and track the activity from the mobile application.

I first setup SquidMan (http://squidman.net/squidman/) to act as a proxy for my iPhone so that I could run a Wireshark capture on the traffic. Next, I set my iPhone to use my MacBook Air as the proxy. (picture)

Once this was all setup, I simply opened the Newegg Mobile application and began poking around to see what would I could find. (picture)

Through some analysis I determined the root url for Newegg's JSON API and by navigation through the mobile application noticed a pattern. It was through this pattern that I was able to extract the necessary entry points to be able to use the API that I have defined in the RubyGem's readme.

I have abstracted basic calls to the API out into the gem and it is currently only on my GitHub account as I have not hosted it on rubygems yet. As far as the application idea that sparked the creation of the gem, I will hopefully have something out soon.
